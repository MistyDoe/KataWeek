## Human Readable Time
Task from CodeWars.com 

**Task**

Write a function, which takes a non-negative integer (seconds) as input and returns the time in a human-readable format (HH:MM:SS)

HH = hours, padded to 2 digits, range: 00 - 99
MM = minutes, padded to 2 digits, range: 00 - 59
SS = seconds, padded to 2 digits, range: 00 - 59
The maximum time never exceeds 359999 (99:59:59)

## House Robber 
Task from leetcode.com

**Task**

You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street.
Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint

return the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.

## Solving Questions with Brainpower
Task from leetcode.com

**Task**

You are given a 0-indexed 2D integer array questions where questions[i] = [points `i` , brainpower `i`].

The array describes the questions of an exam, where you have to process the questions in order 
(i.e., starting from question 0) and make a decision whether to solve or skip each question. 
Solving question `i` will earn you pointsi points but you will be unable to solve each of the next brainpower `i` questions. 
If you skip question `i`, you get to make the decision on the next question.

For example, given questions = [[3, 2], [4, 3], [4, 4], [2, 5]]:
If question 0 is solved, you will earn 3 points but you will be unable to solve questions 1 and 2.
If instead, question 0 is skipped and question 1 is solved, you will earn 4 points but you will be unable to solve questions 2 and 3.
Return the maximum points you can earn for the exam.

Task from leetcode.com

**Task**
A square matrix is said to be an X-Matrix if both of the following conditions hold:

All the elements in the diagonals of the matrix are non-zero.
All other elements are 0.
Given a 2D integer array `grid` of size `n x n` representing a square matrix, return `true` if `grid` is an X-Matrix. Otherwise, return `false`.
